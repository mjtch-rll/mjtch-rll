- 👋 Hi, I’m @mjtch-rll
- 👀 I’m interested in Web3, Web2, serving the common human, data sovereignty, privacy, fun, the best of human nature and the tools and spaces which bring it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a whole lot, all the time; I'm a complete noob - I'd say my biggest learning is how to setup environments, I can read documentation, begin to understand others' code but setting up a damn environment so I can safely build and test things- I'm really needing that.
 - aka: DevOps? Git, JS, React, Node, Web3, GraphQL
 - Web Scraping, ArWeave Permaweb
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an Archiving project, an integration between Bubble.io and ArWeave's Permaweb, a book club/community platform,
